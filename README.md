  <h3 align="center">Notable-Now REST API</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This is the API that I developed utilizing the Node.js framework for the <a href="https://github.com/caglayagmuricerr/notes-app"><strong>Notable-Now</strong></a> application.
    <br />

    🌉The Notable-Now API is like the bridge that helps different parts of the Notable-Now app talk to each other and share information. It's made using Node.js.
    <br/><br/>
    🚪This API provides a bunch of special paths that the app can use to ask for specific things or do certain actions. These paths are like doors that open up to         let data in or out. 
    <br/><br/>
    🔒Safety is also really important. Just like how you lock your front door, this API uses special codes to make sure only the right people can use it and play         with the data. It uses hashed passwords (and maybe hashed texts in the next version) as a security measure.
    <br/><br/>
     📈And the cool part is that this API is built in a way that makes it easy to add more stuff later if the app needs to do new things.
    <br/><br/>
    📝In short, the Notable-Now API made with Node.js uses special paths for getting and sending data, keeps things safe, and can grow as the app gets even bigger.
